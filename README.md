# Goodbye Volcano High (GVH) Modding Project

## Game Info
Game: [**Goodbye Volcano High**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1310330/Goodbye_Volcano_High/)<br/>
Playtime: 5-6 hours<br/>
Engine: **Unity 2021.3.18f1** (*mono*)<br/>
Binary of Interest: ``...\Goodbye Volcano High\Goodbye Volcano High_Data\Managed\Gvh.dll``<br/>
Protections: None.

## Features I want to focus on:
- making the rythm minigame playable using custom beatmaps, perhaps automap-functionality for osu beatmaps and other popular rythm game beatmap formats
- fixing (missing words in) subtitles
- fixing abrupt audio cuts (if they don't come pre-cut like that)
- adding a restart button in the pause menu for the minigame (story)
- way in the future, multiple saves and or time-warp functionality (go back to events that already occured, preferably using a slider with images similiar to a video player, but that's a problem for future me)
- way in the future an easy modding framework like everest for celeste. so that people can develop their own fan-fiction or add their own features to the base game.

## Why do I do this?
the people that paid the full price for this game deserve more. I got it for just under 20â‚¬ and think that additions like these would be so easy to develop/design if you had access to the unity project. it would bring so much extra-content/replayability to the game that it kinda annoys me that I have to figure everything out by myself while developing a full-fledged melonloader mod for this. you can't imagine how hard it is to reuse the ui components of the game and design some user interface/scene with it using code alone.

## Release when?
idk. won't work on the mod all the time. won't have motivation to continue every day. it's a slow process that will take its time. so no eta. it is ready when it is ready. first release comes when the mod has user-generated beatmap support.

## Update 1.0.0
figured out how to customize the title screen. so I added a few buttons.

idk why, but...<br/><br/>
a) I wasn't able to get most of the ui gameobjects directly. they didn't appear when using the GameObject.Find... methods. so I currently step down the hierarchy using the code below.<br/>
edit: I was told this can be caused by objects not being active. they looked active to me in unity explorer though. so potential fix I was told: use Resources.Find... instead?
```csharp
var screen1 =
    FindChild(
        FindChild(
            FindChild(test, "UICanvas"),
        "SafeArea"),
    "Screen1");

...

public static GameObject FindChild(GameObject parent, string name)
{
    if (parent == null)
    {
        MelonLogger.Warning("Parent GameObject is null.");
        return null;
    }

    Transform childTransform = parent.transform.Find(name);
    if (childTransform != null)
    {
        return childTransform.gameObject;
    }
    else
    {
        MelonLogger.Warning($"Child GameObject with name '{name}' not found.");
        return null; // should probably return the parent the more I think about this while writing the readme.md
    }
}
```
b) when getting objects directly using its type/class name, they don't seem to have childrens. so I currently get all objects in the scenes and filter for the ones I want like this:
```csharp
GameObject[] titleSceneObjects = GameObject.FindObjectsOfType<GameObject>();
MelonLogger.Msg($"Total objects found: {titleSceneObjects.Length}");

GameObject[] titleSceneObjects2 = Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll<GameObject>();
MelonLogger.Msg($"Total objects found: {titleSceneObjects2.Length}");

var test = titleSceneObjects.Where(x => x.name == "Title").FirstOrDefault();
MelonLogger.Msg($"{test}: {test.transform.childCount}");
```

## Game Scenes (spoiler):
I spotted a few gaps in between the numbering. I can't tell if this is due to cut content or other reasons.
